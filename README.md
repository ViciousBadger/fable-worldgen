This is a world generation mod for Minecraft that
changes the terrain generation to be really cool
and also adds its own biomes, most are just tweaks
of vanilla minecraft biomes, others are original
ideas. Basically the world is split into 5 climate
zones: polar, boreal, temperate,
subtropical/mediterranean and tropical. Each zone
has its own set of unique dry, wet, wetland,
highland and mountain biomes.

The mod also includes a custom advanced tree
generator used for most of the new trees, the
trunks and branches and leaf placement are much
more configurable in datapack than any of the
vanilla trunk generators. And also there is a rock
generator :3

Mod is WIP, but expected to be in a playable state
very soon.
